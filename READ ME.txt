##   FIRST TIME INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS   ##

  ##########################################

1. Install python 3.8 and the latest version of pip

2. Double click and run install_packages.bat to install python packages
	You can also open it in any text editor and run the commands listed.

	If you get an error saying that pip or python is not recognized as a command, 
	you will need to add python to PATH and make sure pip is installed

# HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT #

1. Navigate to the script_files folder

2. Shift-click inside the folder and select "Open Powershell Window Here"

3. In the blue powershell window that pops up type:

python generate_table.py

4. A windows defender window may come up, just click "allow access" (This will allow python to access the internet)

5. Wait for the script to run

6. Check for the csv file inside the script_files\Output Tables\ folder. There should be one more row than there are entries in the wsj table.
	
	In the unlikely but possible event that there are more or fewer entries than there should be, the script will need to be updated.
	If the script finishes witout going through the whole table, you may just need to run it again
	If the script continually fails to go through the whole table, you may need to add an exception for python.exe in windows defender


If anything else goes wrong, it is probably because wsj changed the layout of their site or one of the packages used in the script has changed.
I documented my code so you should be able to get any competent COEN major to fix it for you.
If you are the COEN major fixing my code, I'm so sorry.
